# NLP_legal_cases
A text retrieval algorithm is developed based on CNN structure for legal case query.
# CNN (DL for NLP)
A CNN based on algorithm is designed to retrieve the most semantically similar case for each query legal case.
1. cnn_bl.py builds the structure for the CNN based algorithm;
2. cnn_bl_eval.py evaluates the algorithm;
3. cnn_train.py presents the training process;

4. cnn_retrain.py presents how to retrain the already trained model;
5. data_helpers.py prepares the data in the required format such as batch data;
